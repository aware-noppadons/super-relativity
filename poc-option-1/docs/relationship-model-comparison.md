│  AppChange  │────AFFECTS────────>│  Component  │
│   AC-001    │  [ADD,MODIFY]      │  COMP-002   │
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘
```
**Characteristics**:
- Single generic relationship
- Type information in property array
- No direct type indexing
- Requires property filtering

## Query Pattern Comparison

### Pattern 1: Find Specific Change Type

**Question**: "Which components are being MODIFIED?"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
MATCH (ac:AppChange)-[:MODIFIES]->(comp:Component)
RETURN comp.name
```
- **Index Usage**: Relationship type index
- **Complexity**: O(log k) where k = MODIFIES relationships
- **Performance**: ~1ms for 10K relationships

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
MATCH (ac:AppChange)-[r:AFFECTS]->(comp:Component)
WHERE 'MODIFY' IN r.changeTypes
RETURN comp.name
```
- **Index Usage**: None (array properties not indexable)
- **Complexity**: O(n) where n = ALL AFFECTS relationships
- **Performance**: ~50ms for 10K relationships (50x slower)

---

### Pattern 2: Count Change Types

**Question**: "How many ADDS vs MODIFIES vs ENABLES?"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
MATCH (ac:AppChange)-[r]->(target)
RETURN type(r) as changeType, count(*) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
```
**Output**:
```
changeType  | count
------------|------
MODIFIES    | 3
ADDS        | 2
ENABLES     | 3
```
- **Simplicity**: Direct aggregation
- **Accuracy**: Each relationship counted once

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
MATCH (ac:AppChange)-[r:AFFECTS]->(target)
UNWIND r.changeTypes as changeType
RETURN changeType, count(*) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
```
**Output**:
```
changeType  | count
------------|------
MODIFY      | 3
ADD         | 2
ENABLE      | 3
```
- **Complexity**: Requires UNWIND
- **Issue**: Double-counting if one relationship has multiple types

---

### Pattern 3: Impact Path Analysis

**Question**: "What's the path from Requirement to Server through changes?"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
MATCH path = (r:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTED_BY]->
             (a:Application)-[:CONTAINS]->
             (c:Container)<-[:MODIFIES]-
             (ic:InfraChange)
RETURN path
```
**Graph Visualization**:
```
Requirement ──IMPLEMENTED_BY──> Application
                                    │
                                 CONTAINS
                                    │
                                    ▼
                                Container <──MODIFIES── InfraChange
```
- **Clear semantics**: Each arrow has meaning
- **Algorithm support**: Can run PageRank, community detection
- **Traversal cost**: Minimal (indexed)

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
MATCH path = (r:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTED_BY]->
             (a:Application)-[:CONTAINS]->
             (c:Container)<-[r:AFFECTS]-
             (ic:InfraChange)
WHERE 'MODIFY' IN r.changeTypes
RETURN path
```
**Graph Visualization**:
```
Requirement ──IMPLEMENTED_BY──> Application
                                    │
                                 CONTAINS
                                    │
                                    ▼
                                Container <──AFFECTS── InfraChange
                                              (must check properties)
```
- **Lost semantics**: Must filter by property
- **Algorithm limitation**: Cannot distinguish AFFECTS types
- **Traversal cost**: Higher (property checks)

---

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Change Risk Assessment

**Business Need**: Calculate risk score based on change types affecting critical servers

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
MATCH (s:Server {criticality: 'High'})<-[r]-(ic:InfraChange)
WITH s,
     sum(CASE type(r) WHEN 'MODIFIES' THEN 10
                      WHEN 'ENABLES' THEN 5
                      WHEN 'ADDS' THEN 2
                      ELSE 0 END) as riskScore
RETURN s.name, riskScore
ORDER BY riskScore DESC
```
**How it works**:
- Direct access to relationship type via `type(r)`
- Built-in `CASE` on relationship type
- Single traversal

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
MATCH (s:Server {criticality: 'High'})<-[r:AFFECTS]-(ic:InfraChange)
UNWIND r.changeTypes as changeType
WITH s, changeType
WITH s,
     sum(CASE changeType WHEN 'MODIFY' THEN 10
                         WHEN 'ENABLE' THEN 5
                         WHEN 'ADD' THEN 2
                         ELSE 0 END) as riskScore
RETURN s.name, riskScore
ORDER BY riskScore DESC
```
**Issues**:
- Requires UNWIND (complexity)
- Multiple passes (UNWIND + aggregation)
- Risk of over-counting if safeguards not in place

---

### Scenario 2: Temporal Analysis

**Business Need**: "Show me timeline of changes to this server"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
MATCH (s:Server {id: 'SRV-005'})<-[r]-(ic:InfraChange)
RETURN
  ic.plannedDate as date,
  type(r) as changeType,
  r.impact as impact,
  ic.name as changeName
ORDER BY date
```
**Output**:
```
date       | changeType | impact  | changeName
-----------|------------|---------|------------------
2025-02-20 | MODIFIES   | High    | Upgrade DB server
2025-03-01 | ENABLES    | Medium  | Enable autoscaling
```
- **Timeline per relationship**: Each relationship has independent properties
- **Clear**: Each row is one change event
- **Queryable**: Can filter `WHERE type(r) = 'MODIFIES'`

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
MATCH (s:Server {id: 'SRV-005'})<-[r:AFFECTS]-(ic:InfraChange)
UNWIND r.changes as change
RETURN
  change.date as date,
  change.type as changeType,
  change.impact as impact,
  ic.name as changeName
ORDER BY date
```
**Required structure**:
```cypher
{
  changes: [
    {type: 'MODIFY', date: '2025-02-20', impact: 'High'},
    {type: 'ENABLE', date: '2025-03-01', impact: 'Medium'}
  ]
}
```
**Issues**:
- Complex nested properties
- Harder to maintain
- UNWIND adds complexity
- Cannot index on nested dates

---

### Scenario 3: Security & Access Control

**Business Need**: User can see ADDS and MODIFIES but not ENABLES (sensitive infrastructure changes)

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
// In application layer or Cypher
WITH ['ADDS', 'MODIFIES'] as allowedTypes
MATCH (ic:InfraChange)-[r]->(target)
WHERE type(r) IN allowedTypes
RETURN ic, r, target
```
**Implementation**:
- Simple `IN` check on relationship type
- Clear access control boundary
- Fast filtering

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
WITH ['ADD', 'MODIFY'] as allowedTypes
MATCH (ic:InfraChange)-[r:AFFECTS]->(target)
WITH ic, r, target, allowedTypes,
     [ct IN r.changeTypes WHERE ct IN allowedTypes] as filteredTypes
WHERE size(filteredTypes) > 0
// Problem: Still shows relationship even if it has ENABLE
// Need complex filtering to hide entire relationship or modify properties
```
**Issues**:
- Complex filtering logic
- All-or-nothing (show entire relationship or none)
- Cannot partially filter array contents in graph display

---

## Performance Simulation

### Test: Find all Components affected by MODIFIES changes

**Dataset**: 10,000 changes, 1,000 components

#### Current Approach
```
Step 1: Index lookup on relationship type "MODIFIES"
        -> Returns 3,333 MODIFIES relationships (1/3 of total)
        Time: 2ms

Step 2: Filter for Component targets
        Time: 1ms

Total: 3ms
```

#### Combined Approach
```
Step 1: Match ALL AFFECTS relationships
        -> Returns 10,000 AFFECTS relationships
        Time: 10ms

Step 2: Filter where 'MODIFY' IN changeTypes (property scan)
        -> Scans 10,000 properties
        Time: 50ms

Step 3: Filter for Component targets
        Time: 2ms

Total: 62ms (20x slower)
```

## Memory & Storage Comparison

### Current Approach

**Per Relationship**:
```
Relationship record: 34 bytes (Neo4j base)
Type string: 8-16 bytes
Properties: ~40 bytes (impact, description, etc.)
Total per edge: ~90 bytes
```

**For 100 relationships**:
```
Storage: 9 KB
Indexes: 2 KB (type index)
Total: 11 KB
```

### Combined Approach

**Per Relationship**:
```
Relationship record: 34 bytes
Type string: 8 bytes ("AFFECTS")
Array property: 50-100 bytes (multiple types)
Properties: ~60 bytes (more complex structure)
Total per edge: ~150 bytes
```

**For 100 relationships** (assuming 30% consolidation):
```
Storage: 10.5 KB (70 edges * 150 bytes)
Indexes: 0 KB (no array index)
Total: 10.5 KB
```

**Savings**: ~0.5 KB (5% reduction)
**Trade-off**: 20x slower queries

**Conclusion**: Negligible storage benefit, massive performance cost

## Graph Algorithm Impact

### PageRank Example

**Use Case**: "Which servers are most critical in the infrastructure?"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
CALL gds.pageRank.stream({
  nodeLabels: ['Server', 'Container'],
  relationshipTypes: ['DEPLOYED_ON', 'MODIFIES', 'ENABLES']
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as name, score
ORDER BY score DESC
```
- **Works perfectly**: Algorithm understands relationship types
- **Accurate**: Different relationship types weighted appropriately
- **Fast**: Native graph traversal

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
CALL gds.pageRank.stream({
  nodeLabels: ['Server', 'Container'],
  relationshipTypes: ['DEPLOYED_ON', 'AFFECTS']
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as name, score
ORDER BY score DESC
```
**Problems**:
- Cannot distinguish MODIFIES from ENABLES in algorithm
- All AFFECTS relationships weighted equally
- Loses semantic meaning in centrality calculation
- Wrong results for architectural analysis

---

## Schema Evolution Scenarios

### Scenario: Add new change type "DEPRECATES"

#### Current Approach ✅
```cypher
// Simply create new relationship type
MATCH (ac:AppChange {id: 'AC-004'}), (comp:Component {id: 'COMP-005'})
CREATE (ac)-[:DEPRECATES {
  impact: 'Low',
  timeline: '6 months'
}]->(comp)
```
**Impact**:
- No existing queries break
- New queries can filter specifically for DEPRECATES
- Old queries ignore it (unless using generic pattern)
- Schema grows organically

#### Combined Approach ❌
```cypher
// Add to array
MATCH (ac:AppChange {id: 'AC-004'}), (comp:Component {id: 'COMP-005'})
CREATE (ac)-[:AFFECTS {
  changeTypes: ['DEPRECATE'],
  impact: 'Low',
  timeline: '6 months'
}]->(comp)
```
**Impact**:
- Need to update all queries that enumerate types
- Application code must handle new type
- No database-level validation
- Easy to have inconsistent type names (DEPRECATES vs DEPRECATE)
